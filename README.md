## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Set up an editor (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor)
3. Install Dart plugin and Flutter plugin
4. Install Flutter packages (`flutter pub get`)

## Build
Run `flutter run` to build the app.

## Inspiration
Team Gro was inspired by the idea of taking care of the environment. Thus, we decided to create a mobile application so that the users would have an easier time to take care of their personal plant.

## What it does
Gro keeps track of how often the user can put water into their plant. Additionally, they can search through the trefle.io API so that they can keep track of multiple plants to take care of. 
## How we built it
We used the Flutter for front-end and Firebase for back-end.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time using Firebase so it was difficult to implement it onto our mobile application. Additionally, we struggled to search through the API using Flutter but we pulled through. We were able to do so by implementing StreamBuilder so that the information from the API can be updated in real time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We understood the concept of Firebase really well and finished our idea of the project.

## What we learned
We learned about Firebase, specifically user authentification and cloud storage.

## What's next for Gro
Machine learning so that the app can detect what plant the user is taking a picture of, more details on the plant description screen and for your personal plants.
